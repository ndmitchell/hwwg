# The Haskell.org Website Working Group (HWWG)

## Scope and goals

* The HWWG is responsible for the design and content of the user-facing haskell.org web site, including tutorials, videos, news, resource, downloads, etc.
* The HWWG is not responsible for:
  * The infrastructure of haskell.org
  * Toolchains, Hackage, compilers, etc
* The HWWG focuses on serving users of Haskell, not suppliers of technology or libraries.
* An explicit goal is to re-unite the haskell.org and haskell-lang.org web sites.

## Expected mode of operation

* HWWG is not responsible for actually doing everything!  The web site is on github.  Anyone can make a pull request.  The general expectation is that uncontroversial changes will be accepted and committed without much debate.
* If there is disagreement about a proposed change, it's up to the HWWG to engage in (open) debate, and to seek input as widely as time allows, but finally to make a decision.

# Membership

Initial membership comprises of:

* Neil Mitchell (chair)
* Nicolas Wu
* Andrew Cowie
* Vincent Hanquez
* Ryan Trinkle
* Chris Done

It is expected the committee will change over time, but the mechanism has not yet been thought about.

## Rules of engagement

* Recognising that honestly-held judgements may differ, we will be scrupulously polite both in public and in private.
* Recognising that Haskell has many users, and that different users have different needs and tastes, we want haskell.org to be inclusive rather than exclusive, providing a variety of alternative resources (toolchains, tutorials, books, etc) clearly signposted with their intended audiences.
* Ultimately the haskell.org committee owns the haskell.org URL, but it delegates authority for the design and content of the web site to the HWWG.  In extremis, if the haskell.org committee believes that the HWWG is mismanaging the web site, it can revoke that delegation.
